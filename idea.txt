buttons in a lazy column (like a list) they have a cooldown to be pressed like Adventure captalist. I'll make two lists one for the exp they give and other for the cooldowns. I create a lazy column and use these two lists so i can create multiple buttons. I also need to create a second screen showing the upgrades for the buttons, like a upgrade skills activity and also a profile screen where i see my lvl, achievments and any other useful things
